# A tailored list of developer prompts üìã

Every good software engineer needs good prompts!

This repo is filled of **amazing prompt for developers**, mapped with my favorite text expander, [Espanso](https://espanso.org).

üëâ *You are not forced to use a text expander tool but this is highly recommended!*

‚ôªÔ∏è This is a WIP one, do not hesitate to contribute kicking errors and improving prompts!

## A french community

Join a group of french software engineers that are using AI.

## Do not use ChatGPT

I prompted two AI to act like the best software engineers.

* [Prefer using CodeGPT FR (in you are francophone)](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-RmIJzZYzS-code-gpt) üá´üá∑
* [Prefer using CodeGPT (english version)](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-S1wfMarvA-ai-programming-expert) üåé

> It is working much better that the original version and works even better with the prompts under.

## Text expansion

### Installation

Follow the [Espanso installation guide here](https://espanso.org/install/) for your operating system.

```shell
espanso install prompts-dev --git git@github.com:alexsoyes/prompts-dev.git --external
```

In order to have the updates, just:

```shell
espanso package update prompts-dev
espanso package update all # or if you want to update all your packages at once :)
```

### Usage

In combination with ChatGPT (or another generative AI).

Use this timeline to find and fix bugs.

* Either by using a keyboard shortcut (like `:cd...`)
* Or by using the dialog box (`‚å• + SPACE` or `ALT + SPACE`)

#### Quick demo

It saved hours.

## Contribution

* Community prompt list, so create a PR with your needs ‚ù§Ô∏è
* Report prompting issues / improvements at [hello@alexsoyes.com](mailto:hello@alexsoyes.com)

## Prompts list

I tried to respect the following convention.

* `:{group}` : Either code related or prompt related.
* `{optionalLanguageShort}` : Like `ts` for TypeScript related things.
* `{action}` : A verb, a wish or an actions suite.

### Global dev prompts `:pr`

Related to prompts chatting.

#### Who am I? `:prtsme`

```text

```

#### My project configuration `:prproject`

```text
I need help for my current project and I need you to help me as an experimented mentor, developer and agile coach.

My project is about:

[[Fully detailed explanation]]

This only project I will refer to you within this conversation is only about this one.

I will try to always provide to you the relevant code associated to the feature or bug or whatever I talk you about.

```

#### Recode the feature `:prrecode`

```text
Your code does not work as excepted.

[[Explanation why it is failing]]

Can you auto-evaluate your own work?

1) Remind you the goal and try another way to code it.
2) Keep in mind that the code needs to be errorless and get the proper result I asked you about.
3) Can you remind me the goal, the entry parameters and the expect output?
4) Then provide the steps in order to fix the code you wrote.
5) Lastly, check for the generated code in order to be sure that it fits my needs.

Thank you for you professionalism.

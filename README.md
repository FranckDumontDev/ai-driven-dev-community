# Developer's prompts

**Every good software engineer needs a good prompt!**

This repo is filled of **amazing prompt for developers**, mapped with my favorite text expander, [Espanso](https://espanso.org).

üëâ *You are not forced to use a text expander tool but this is highly recommended!*

DO NOT USE CHATGPT!

* Prefer using CodeGPT FR (in you are francophone) üá´üá∑
* Or the International version CodeGPT Global üåé

### Global dev prompts `:pr`

Related to prompts chatting.

#### Who am I? `:prtsme`

```text
I am a senior software engineer on JavaScript but I prefer to use TypeScript.

The libraries I am using are: React, NextJS, Zod, React-Hook-Form, Tailwind.

I need help to write 100% working and clean code.
```

#### My project configuration `:prproject`

```text
I need help for my current project and I need you to help me as an experimented mentor, developer and agile coach.

My project is about:

[[Fully detailed explanation]]

This only project I will refer to you within this conversation is only about this one.

Technically speaking, here are the libs we are using for our project:

```

#### Ask for a feature `:prfeat`

```text
I am building a new feature for my project.

Goal of the feature: [[context]]
Incoming parameters are: [[params]]

‚Ü∫ Discuss with the AI until it understood **what you really mean**.

#### Code the feature `:prcode`

```text
You did understand the feature I want to code.
Now, I need your to write the code following my projects requirements (both technical and from a user view).

You should:

* Spit files (only if needed, respecting clean code principles and other good practices)
* Not put into comment
* Function / Variables names must be short, in english and really matching the expected outcome
```

#### Recode the feature `:prrecode`

```text
Your code does not work as excepted.

[[Explanation why it is failing]]

Can you auto-evaluate your own work?

1) Remind you the goal and try another way to code it.
2) Keep in mind that the code needs to be errorless and get the proper result I asked you about.
3) Can you remind me the goal, the entry parameters and the expect output?
4) Then provide the steps in order to fix the code you wrote.
5) Lastly, check for the generated code in order to be sure that it fits my needs.

Thank you for you professionalism.

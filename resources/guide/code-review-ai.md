## GitHub Action : PR-Agent (by Codium) - Free

[PR Agent by Codium](https://github.com/Codium-ai/pr-agent) is the code reviewing tool we are using in this repository.

It is connected to OpenAI and is able to review are code in a cool way.

*Of course you need an OpenAI API key to make it work.*

This tool impresses me so much.

[CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai/) has the advantage of always providing a suggestion that you can apply.

Rules:
- Look for that information in your knowledge base to provide the best answer.
- If user-story is too big, group features the more you can.
- You MUST provide every required steps, do not forget anything.
- Do not generate code or command line instructions, focus on precise steps to achieve the outcome.
- It should include epics, user stories with acceptance criteria, sub-tasks.

Requested Feature (delimited by "---"):
---
[[Feature to build, be as detailed as possible]]
---

[[Project and lib setup have already been done | Project and lib setup might not have been done]].

Here is a styled markdown template example you can inspire yourself with (surrounded by "---" delimiter):
---
# Feature's name with Epic

## "User Story 1"

* Acceptance Criteria:
  * Given: ...
  * When: ...
  * Then: ...
  * And: ...

  * Full step to achieve the outcome
  * ...
---
```

### Extract development steps `:featExtractDevSteps`

**Prompt**:

```text
Given the task detailed below (surrounded by "---" delimiters), can you provide me with the development steps for each sub-task?

---
[[sub task full description]]
---

1. For each question, search into knowledge base.
2. Recall name, tech stack and libraries from [[package.json | composer.json | requirements.txt]] in the knowledge base.
3. Concentrate solely on the task at hand.
4. Identify any potential missing sub-tasks.
5. Reformulate tasks in one line.
6. Look for that information in your `project-documentation.txt` file in your knowledge base to provide the best answer.
7. Provide one-line action steps, specifying new or existing file paths without generating code.
```

### Extract coding steps `:featExtractCodingSteps`

Now, can you:
- Acknowledge it.
- Reformulate in bullet point grouped by section to show me that you understood what to do.
- Generate development steps (based on an existing projet you do not know nothing about).

Finally, ask me the relevant questions about implementing the feature in my project regarding my project's tech stack and libraries.

Ask anything you need to know, like existing code, libraries, mockups available, logics, etc.

Here are some answers about your previous questions.

Note that I cannot provide you with the full code, nor answer every details of the question.

Can you merge this new information together with the previous ones, and then:

- If there is not absolute need for more details, only give me the required development steps involved in coding the functionality?
- If you definitely need more details, please only ask me the crippling questions.

Here are my answers:

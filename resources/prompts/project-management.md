For the first answer, shortly explain in 1 sentence the user what we are doing here.

Then, give him bullet points of the markdown template (with only the heading 1) to explain him what we are going to fill.

Finally, start to dialog with the user. The aim is to fill the template about during that discussion.

Your job is to:
* get the data from the user.
* treat it to understand it and fill the template in the proper section.
* user might gave answer not in the order from the template, it is your task to organize it in a better way
* do challenge the user about the answers he gave you
* goal is to construct a well formatted exhaustive document for the team so everyone knows what we are talking about
* wait for the user to tell you to move the next section, otherwise, ask him if he wants more help regarding what he just type and ask him if everything is ok an if you can continue. Warn the user if the template is not fully filled.
* before going to the next section, ask the user if he wants to get the output of the things you just said
* your first question is: "tell me about your project".

Regarding the technology project I am planning and giving the specifications, I need guidance on selecting the right tools and frameworks.
I have a team of developers (can be only 1 developer) ready to work on this, and they are open to learning new technologies if needed.
Please base your answers on the template we filled together.

Here are the key aspects of my project and requirements:

1. Overview of Developer Skills (please read the developer expertises based on their web resume):

[[Please provide URLs to the developers' resumes for reference.]]

2. Project Needs: I'm considering various technologies for different aspects of the project, but not all may be necessary. It also depends on the selected tools, for example, If I am using NextJS with Vercel, database might not be needed).
My tech stack could include:
   - Frontend frameworks.
   - Frontend UI lib or framework (must fit the chosen frontend framework).
   - Browser extension guidelines (can be optional depending on the specifications).
   - Backend (can be optional depending on the specifications).
   - User authentication systems.
   - Database (can be optional depending on the specifications).
   - Web hosting with email service (can be optional depending on the specifications).
   - Version control platform with Continuous Integration (CI).
   - Containerization (can be optional depending on the specifications).

For each of those stack, please guess If this is needed or not regarding my project requirements.

3. Selection Criteria:
   - My project requirements from the template we filled together.
   - Performance: The solutions should be fast and efficient.
   - Ease of Use: User-friendly and quick to implement.
   - Cost-Effectiveness: Affordable options are preferred.
   - Integration: Technologies should integrate well with each other.
   - Community Support: Choose technologies with a strong community and ongoing improvements. Tools that are not actively maintained are forbidden (like ExpressJS which is very popular but not backed anymore).
   - Time to Market: The focus is on a rapid launch for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

Based on these criteria and the developers' expertise, what is the best technology stack that you would recommend for each requirement? (If more than one tool is necessary, please specify.)

Please format your answer like this (surrounded by "---" delimiters):
---
Project Needs:
- Recommended.
- Why.
- Needed for the current project from the template (y/n with short explanation).
- Alternative.

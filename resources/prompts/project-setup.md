### Good practices setup `:instructSetupGoodPractices`

```text
Regarding my used project technologie, can you help me to enforce the following good practices in my application?

- Code format
- Linting
- Tests before commit
- Build before push
- Force good commit convention from conventional commit (or equivalent)
- SemVer version management
- Major updates notice (in CI)
- Minor and security updates automatically install

Then, for each steps, detail the step by step things to setup those improvements regarding my project's config.

Use the latest version of tools unless I do specify otherwise.

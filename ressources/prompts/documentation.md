Please provide the best step by step way to it.

For each step, detail your explanation with the proper code.

## üí¨ Comments

### Comments must match code actions `:docCommentCheckCodeIsMatching`

```text
Check that comments are matching code actions.

- If so, just reply "OK ‚úÖ" without saying anything else.
- If not, update the comments to match the code with a concise and simple one describing what the inner code is doing.

Rules:
  - Go to line on new sentence.
  - Check for comment params to match function's params.
  - Check if "TODO" are still relevant, if not, remove them. You must be very sure that they are not relevant to remove them.
```

```text
Comment the code to make the hard parts easier to understand.
```

- Add top file documentation to describe what the file is doing

```
